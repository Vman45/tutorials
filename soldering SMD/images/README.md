## What is SMD Soldering

Every aspect of surface mount soldering was engineered to make large-scale PCB assembly faster and more reliable. With proper setup and execution, everyone can enjoy the benefits of SMD soldering on their projects!

## SMD Soldering in 6 Easy Steps
1. Wipe PCB with alcohol
2. Align solder paste stencil
3. Squeegee solder paste over stencil
4. Carefully remove stencil
5. Place components
6. Reflow inside pre-configured SMD reflow oven

> But don't let the small amount of steps fool you, SMD soldering can be tricky if not approached correctly. We'll continue the tutorial by first introducing the tools before going through each step in more detail.

## Know Your Tools
* **Solder Paste** SMD soldering uses solder paste to form the electrical connections. Solder paste is almost like *powdered* metal solder suspended inside a high-viscosity flux. <br><img width="400" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/1.jpg"><br>image courtesy of.. <br><br>
* **Solder Stencil** Usually ~0.005 inches thick of either stainless steel or polyimide (Kapton) sheet with precise apetures cut for each footprint on the PCB. <br><img width="400" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/osh1.jpg"><img width="400" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/osh2.jpg"><br>image courtesy of.. <br><br>
* **Squeegee** A tool used to pushed solder paste into the holes of the stencil. A squeegee's thickness and flat edge play a big role in the successfullness of the stenciling process. We use modified putty knifes in lab64, but there are many other (better) options. <br><img width="400" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/10.jpg"><br>image courtesy of OSHstencils<br><br>
* **Mounting Fixture** Probably the most difficult part of solder stencil work is figuring out how to hold the PCB and stencil. In the lab64 tutorial, we have built a nice fixture to make things go smoothly. However, when trying this on your own, it's common to hold the PCB and stencil like this: <br><img width="400" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/osh5.jpg"><img width="400" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/osh6.jpg"><br>image courtesy of OSHstencils<br>
