## What is SMD Soldering
<br><img width="800" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/9bbb.jpg"><br>

Every aspect of surface mount soldering was engineered to make large-scale PCB assembly faster and more reliable. With proper setup and execution, everyone can enjoy the benefits of SMD soldering on their projects!

## SMD Soldering in 6 Easy Steps
1. Mount PCB in fixure
2. Align solder paste stencil
3. Squeegee solder paste over stencil
4. Carefully remove stencil
5. Place components
6. Reflow inside pre-configured SMD reflow oven

> But don't let the small amount of steps fool you, SMD soldering can be tricky if not approached correctly. We'll continue the tutorial by first introducing the tools before going through each step in more detail.

## Know Your Tools
* **Solder Paste** SMD soldering uses solder paste to form the electrical connections. Solder paste is almost like *powdered* metal solder suspended inside a high-viscosity flux. <br><img width="400" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/1.jpg"><br>The goal of SMD soldering is to prepare each pad on the PCB with a *just* the right amount of solder paste which can then melt and bond to the component leads like this:<br><img width="400" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/6.gif"><br><br>
* **Solder Stencil** Usually ~0.005 inches thick of either stainless steel or polyimide (Kapton) sheet with precise apetures cut for each footprint on the PCB. <br><img width="400" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/osh1.jpg"><img width="400" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/osh2.jpg"><br>image courtesy of OSHstencils <br><br>
* **Squeegee** A tool used to pushed solder paste into the holes of the stencil. A squeegee's thickness and flat edge play a big role in the successfullness of the stenciling process. We use modified putty knifes in lab64, but there are many other (better) options. <br><img width="400" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/10.jpg"><br><br>
* **Mounting Fixture** Probably the most difficult part of solder stencil work is figuring out how to hold the PCB and stencil. The successfullness of your stencil job relies on the planarity between the board and your stencil! In the lab64 tutorial, we have built a nice fixture to make things go smoothly. However, when trying this on your own, it's common to hold the PCB and stencil like this: <br><img width="400" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/osh5.jpg"><img width="400" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/osh6.jpg"><br>image courtesy of OSHstencils<br>

## Detailed lab64 Procedure
1. This exercise uses a PCB mounting fixture. Although the fixture won't look exactly like the clip below, the first step of our SMD soldering tutorial will involve carefully placing the PCB inside the fixture. <br><img width="800" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/5.gif"><br>clip courtesy of <br><br>

## SMD Soldering by Hand
SMD soldering can still be benifical even if you don't have a stencil or reflow oven. Below are some tips/techniques to try in your own lab.<br><br>
* **Hand-dispensing Solder Paste** Although stencils make quick work of paste dispensing, it can also be done by hand. Using either a toothpick-like tool or the syringe tip (if purchased with your paste), apply a small amount to each pad like so: <br><img width="800" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/7.gif"><br>clip courtesy of <br><br>
* **Hot Air Tools** There are a multitude of hot air soldering/rework tools on the market. Below is a clip illustrating how heat, flux, and surface tension can "magically" solder the leads of a quad-flat pack (QFP) with very little bridging (and shows how to fix when bridges do occur): <br><img width="800" src="https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/blob/master/soldering%20SMD/images/9b.gif"><br>clip courtesy of <br><br>
